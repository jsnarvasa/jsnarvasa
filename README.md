# :~. Jesse S. Narvasa

Hi there, I'm a production engineer within the financial services industry by day, and part-time Master of Data Science student at The University of Sydney by night.

This GitHub account includes projects I've worked on during my undergrad, postgrad, as well as side-projects over the years.
